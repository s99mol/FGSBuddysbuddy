Version 0.3.2 2025-10-18
Improved detection of suggested root when loading xsd file.

Version 0.3.1 2025-10-13
Fixed when loading input file after xsd file, it overwrites "-> XSD Element" under "Add New Simple Mapping".
Fixed when re-loading xsd file, dropdowns can be too large in vertical size so that the arrow to the right is hidden.

Version 0.3.0 2025-09-07
Substantially reworked with new tab based GUI:
* Input Analyser: Load xml, json or csv as input file, preview as table & hierarchy and pass keys to XSLT Mapper tab.
* XSLT Mapper: Map objects, configure xslt and generate files (xslt, xml).
* Transformer: Transform with xslt stylesheet to xml. Option to validate xml file.
* Validator: Validate xml file
* Package Creator (SIP): This is for now just a reference to FGS Buddy

See folder Test_v0_3_0 for testing of xslt generation.

Known issues:
* Not possible to name the xml file when using "Generate, Transform and Validate in one go".
* If you use more than one screen, the pop-up windows might turn up on another screen than expected.
* There are cases where you need to restart Buddysbuddy to generate xslt, since there are no delete buttons. It's not always possible to delete values manually.
* When configuring XSLT hierarchy with objects without a mapping, all input data is dumped into the xsl since there is no template. This should be fixed by creating empty templates.

- Error message no inputfile: OK
- Error message no xsltfile: OK
- Error message when no schemafile when inputfile 'testmetadata_output.xml' and chooser 'Enbart xml-validering': OK
- Inputfile: 'testmetadata_output.xml' and 'testmetadata_output_error.xml', schemafile 'arendehantering.xsd', chooser 'Enbart xml-validering': OK
- Inputfile 'testdatainput.csv', funktionchooser 'Csv-inputstatistik', creates folder with 5 files in cwd and some statistics in program window: OK
- Repeat above 5 times = 5 more folders created with same 5 files in each: OK
- Error-message when try to create statistics from xml-file: Yes, but wrong error-message.
Chooser 'Skapa metadatafil':
- Inputfile 'testdatainput.xml', no schemafile: create in cwd and home, errorwarning when already exists: OK
